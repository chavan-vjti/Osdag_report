The Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data model is intended to describe building and construction industry data. It is a platform neutral, open file format specification that is not controlled by a single vendor or group of vendors. It is an object-based file format with a data model developed by buildingSMART (formerly the International Alliance for Interoperability, IAI) to facilitate interoperability in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry, and is a commonly used collaboration format in Building information modeling (BIM) based projects. The IFC model specification is open and available.[1] It is registered by ISO and is an official International Standard ISO 16739:2013.
There are various IFC schema are available and 3 IFC file formats are available as IFC-SPF, IFC-XML and IFC-ZIP.
However, here I have focused on IFC2X3 scheme and IFC-SPF file format. SPF stand here as STEP Physical File.
To generate an IFC file of existing TopoDS CAD model, you need to have IFCOPENSHELL repo placed in site-packages. Don't try to install it through any python package manager.
Typically, any IFC file if you open it in any editor, it consist of 2 sections as header and data section.
Header section consist of general description about IFC file such as IFC IFC_name, IFC_Schema, which software is used to export the IFC file and so on.
Whereas data section actually contains the coordinates to create the CAD model in IFC file format. The commands such as IFCDIRECTION, IFCCARTESIANPOINT, IFCAXIS2PLACEMENT3D are important to create an IFC CAD model.
