This chapter contains the hyperlinks to python files and brief description about each file.
Whenever we begin for CAD development of any new module in Osdag, we initially prepare it's CAD model with hard coded values, by hard coded I meant that we keep every dimension fixed and create a sample CAD model. Once, this is approved by sir and the calculation file of new module is ready the we start for proper python files.
Followings are the hard coded python files of CAD model;
1) Beam-beam extended both way (https://github.com/chavan-vjti/Osdag_Self/blob/master/Connections/Moment/Beam_Beam/Inputs_For_CAD.py)
2) Beam-beam cover plate bolted (https://github.com/chavan-vjti/Osdag_Self/blob/master/Connections/Moment/Beam_Beam_cover_plates/cover_plate_calc.py)
3) For Trusses
	a) Single angle (https://github.com/chavan-vjti/Osdag_Self/blob/TrussSample/Connections/Truss/SingleAngle.py)
	b) Double angle opposite side (https://github.com/chavan-vjti/Osdag_Self/blob/TrussSample/Connections/Truss/DoubleAngleOpposite.py)
	c) Double angle same side (https://github.com/chavan-vjti/Osdag_Self/blob/TrussSample/Connections/Truss/DoubleAngleSameSide.py)
	d) Channel truss (https://github.com/chavan-vjti/Osdag_Self/blob/TrussSample/Connections/Truss/channel_truss.py)
4) 2D drawing (front view) of single angle (https://github.com/chavan-vjti/Osdag_Self/blob/truss_drawing/Connections/Truss/drawing_2D/drawing_2D.py)
