1) CAD model generation in Osdag
The geometric kernel used in Osdag is OpenCascade where PythonOCC is considered to be the wrapper over the kernel. The modeling scheme used in OpenCascade is Boundary Representation (BRep) with geometric pri itives as vertex, edge, face, body and prism. Operators used in BRep are called as Boolean operators with the boolean operations as add, subtract and union. This is what the fundamental used for CAD development in Osdag.

As shown in the above figure, the python files in Component directory are backbone of CAD model in Osdag. Each python file in Component directory is a class file which returns the 3D CAD model of whatever dimensions passed to each python file.
viz. in a case of plate.py which includes a class object as Plate and it takes in inputs as length (L), width(W) and thickness (T) to create the CAD model of plate. Therefore, whatever dimensions you pass on in to this (plate.py) class file, subsequent CAD model of plate would get generated. Similar logic is applied to rest of the class files.
