Work accomplished in an year;
1) Video tutorials along with the scripts
2) CAD Model for BothwayExtended
3) CAD model of Splice Cover Plate
4) CAD model of Truss:
	a) Single angle
	b) Double angle same side
	c) Double angle opposite side
	e) Channel truss connection
5) 2D drawing for Truss Single angle and double angle both side
5) IFC file of CAD Model

Flow of data for report preparation
1) How CAD model is built in Osdag (the flow of variables)
2) IFC file generation and future objectives
3) Provide hyperlinks to github files and google docs

List of chapters
1) CAD model generation
	- Image of Pycharm with list of python files in Component report
	- Start example by Fin plate shear connection
2) IFC model generation
	- Define what IFC is and its application
	- Explain few available function in Connection.ifc
	- State work done and future scope
3) Way (hyperlinks) to many CAD files with detailed description
