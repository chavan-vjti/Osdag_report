\chapter{Hyperlinks to python files of CAD}
\section{Overview}
This chapter contains the hyperlinks to python files and brief description about each file.\\
Whenever we begin for CAD development of any new module in Osdag, the first step in CAD development is to prepare it's CAD model of connection using hard coded values, by hard coded I meant that we keep every dimension fixed and create a sample CAD model. Once, this is approved by sir and the calculation file of concerned module is ready then we start for proper python class files.
Followings are the hard coded python files of CAD model;

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \href{https://github.com/chavan-vjti/Osdag_Self/blob/master/Connections/Moment/Beam_Beam/Inputs_For_CAD.py}{Beam-beam extended both way}
	\item \href{https://github.com/chavan-vjti/Osdag\_Self/blob/master/Connections/Moment/Beam\_Beam_cover_plates/cover_plate_calc.py}{Beam-beam cover plate bolted}
	\item For Trusses, 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \href{https://github.com/chavan-vjti/Osdag_Self/blob/TrussSample/Connections/Truss/SingleAngle.py}{Single angle}
			\item \href{https://github.com/chavan-vjti/Osdag_Self/blob/TrussSample/Connections/Truss/DoubleAngleOpposite.py}{Double angle opposite side}
			\item \href{https://github.com/chavan-vjti/Osdag_Self/blob/TrussSample/Connections/Truss/DoubleAngleSameSide.py}{Double angle same side}
			\item \href{https://github.com/chavan-vjti/Osdag_Self/blob/TrussSample/Connections/Truss/channel_truss.py}{Channel truss}
		\end{itemize}
	\item \href{https://github.com/chavan-vjti/Osdag_Self/blob/truss_drawing/Connections/Truss/drawing_2D/drawing_2D.py}{2D drawing (front view) of single angle}
